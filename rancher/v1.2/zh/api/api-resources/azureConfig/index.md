## azureConfig


The configuration to launch an instance in Microsoft Azure. For all cloud providers, Rancher is calling `docker-machine`, so any available options in `docker-machine` are exposed in Rancher. The default fields from `docker-machine` are not listed in the Rancher API, and they can be found in the `docker-machine` documentation.
